# Contest-involving-consideration
<b> Issue </b> Concerning issues when hosting a contest that may involve consideration - some states prohibit the payment of consideration to enter into any skilled contests, while most are permitted but must eliminate 'chance'.  

Gaming laws are set up by each individual State. Some laws are restrictive against any contest that requires consideration to participant, and this includes contests such as marathons (most of them don't permit residences of Arizona, Guam or Puerto Rico to participate). 

States with restrictions: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Montana, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont and Washington.

<b> Alaska*</b> - 2001 Attorney General Opinion - http://www.tax.alaska.gov/programs/documentviewer/viewer.aspx?820r
AS 11.66.280: "Gambling" means that a person stakes or risks something of value upon the outcome of a contest of chance or a future contingent event not under the person's control or influence, upon an agreement or understanding that the person or someone else will receive something of value in the event of a certain outcome. 
<p> Note - "risk" - in the case where the person pays a consideration but there is no risk of losing what they've paid for then it will not be considered as gambling. Also note from AG letter, however, "stake" or "risk" includes entry fee or purchase that is required as condition to enter a game or contest unless there is a free altnerative method of entry without staking or risking something of value. 

<p>
<b>Arizona**</b> - gambling is generally prohibited under state law with exceptions - even 'amusement gambling'.
<p>"Gambling" requires (1) an act of risking or giving something of value (2) opportunity to obtain a benefit and (3) from a game or contest of chance or skill or a future contingent event. "Act of risking or giving something of value" means the loss of something with economic, monetary or exchange value (e.g., money wagered or used to operate or participate in a game or contest), but if no money or nothing of value is required to participate, then the conduct is not "gambling."
<p>
13-3301.1 "Amustment gambling" means gambling involving a device, game or contest which is played for entertainment if all of the following apply:
(a) the player or players actively participate in the game or contest or with the device
(b) the outcome is not in the control to any material degree of any person other than the player or players
(c) the prizes are not offered as lure to separate the player or players from their money
(d) any of the following:
  (i) no benefit is given to the player or players other than an immediate and unrecorded right to replay which is not exchangeable for value 
  (ii) the gambling is an athletic event and no person other than the player or players derives a profit or chance of profit from the money paid to gamble by the player or players
  (iii) the gambling is an intellectual contest or event, the money paid to gamble is part of an established purchase price for a product, no increment has been added to the price in connection with the gambling event and no drawing or lottery is held to determine the winner or winners
  (iv) Skill and chance is clearly the predominant factor in the game and adds of winning the game based upon chance cannot be altered, provided the game complies with any licensing or regulatory requirements by the jdx in which it is operated, no benefit for a single win is gvien to the player or players other than a merchandise prize which has a wholesale fair market value of less than $4 or coupons which are redeemable only at the place of play and only for a merchandise prize which has a fair market value of less than $4 and regardless of the number of wins, no aggregate of coupons may be redeemed for a merchandise prize with a wholesale fair market value of greater than $550. 
<p>13-3301.4 "Gambling" means one act of risking or giving something of value for the opportunity to obtain a benefit from a game or contest of chance or skill or a future contingent event but does not include bona fide business transactions which are valid under the laws of contracts including contracts for the purchase or sale at a future date of securities or commodities, contracts of indemnity or guarantee and life, health or accident insurance. 
<p>13-3311. Amusement gambling intellectual contests or events; registration; filing of rules; sworn statement; exceptions
 A. Before any person conducts an amusement gambling intellectual contest or event pursuant to section 13-3301, paragraph 1, subdivision (d), item (iii), the person shall register with the AG's office. Registration shall include: (1) the name and address of the person conducting the contest or event, (2) the min dollar amount of all prizes to be awarded, (3) the duration of the event, (4) the statutory agent or person authorized to accept service of process in Arizona for the person conducting the contest or event, (5)all rules governing the contest or event, including the rules applicable in case of a tie, (6) the name and description of the product and the established purchase price of the product;

 D. This section does not apply to qualfieid exemptions ...(schools etc). 
<p> Conclusion: A strict reading of Arizona’s law on gambling indicates that any skill contest requiring an entry fee, as opposed to a product purchase, would constitute illegal gambling.

<b> Arkansas </b>
The Arkansas code does not define the terms "Gambling" or "gaming". The Arkansas Supreme Court, however, has defined gambling as "the risking of money between two or more persons, on a contest or chance of any kind, where one must be the loser and the other gainer." Furthermore, the court has treated the two terms as interchangeable. (Sharp v. State) 
<p> A.C.A Section 5-66-104: "Every person who shall set up... any gaming table or gambling device...or any other gaming table or gambling device, or bank of the like or similar kind, or of any other description although not herein named.... adapted, devised, or designed for the purpose of playing any game of chance, OR at which any money or property may be won or lost, shall be deemed guilty of misdemeanor. 
<p> Generally speaking, a “gambling device” and, by extension of the synonymous definition of “gaming” adopted by the court, a “gaming table,” is “an invention to determine the question as to who wins and who loses, that risk their money on a contest or chance of any kind.” Portis v. State, 27 Ark. 360, 362 (1872). A device may be a prohibited gambling device by being either a per se gambling device or a gambling device by “actual use.” (http://ag.arkansas.gov/opinions/docs/2007-247.html)
350 Ark. 539, 534, 88 S.W.3d 848 (2002). A per se gaming device is, therefore, a device or invention that is adapted or designed to determine the winner and loser in a game of chance and whose only reasonable and profitable use is to play a game of chance.
